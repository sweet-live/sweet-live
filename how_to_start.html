              to choose how do you want to play them? If you want to play on the
              couch infront of TV, sometimes with your friends or family at the
              same place the best choice for you will be to buy gaming console,
              because you can easily get an extra remote and play it from the
              same TV, however other purposes about which we will talk later,
